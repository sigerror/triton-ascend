# Triton-Ascend

## Project Overview and Value Proposition
Triton-Ascend is a Triton compilation framework built for the Ascend platform, aiming to enable Triton code to run efficiently on Ascend hardware.
- #### Core Value
Triton is a Python-based compilation framework that has been favored by developers in recent years. Developers only need to focus on the tile/block slicing mode and the computation logic based on tiles/blocks. During the compilation of Triton code, the compiler automatically completes memory allocation, data transfer, data computation, and pipeline parallelism based on the characteristics of underlying hardware. This greatly reduces the operator development difficulty and significantly improves the development efficiency. 
Triton-Ascend adapts the Triton compilation stack to Huawei Ascend NPUs and provides a series of optimizations based on Triton, so that Triton code can run efficiently on Ascend hardware after compilation. 
Currently, Triton-Ascend is still being improved. We will continuously improve the completeness of Triton Python APIs, support more data types, make memory access more flexible, and continuously optimize the automatic optimization capability of the compiler to improve the overall functionality and performance generalization of Triton-Ascend.
- #### Ascend Ecosystem Positioning
The Triton-Ascend compilation framework removes the barriers between Triton and Ascend hardware, enabling developers who are familiar with the Triton framework to use Ascend NPUs more efficiently. It provides a universal and efficient operator development paradigm, which is a key part of agile development for the Ascend software stack. This greatly enriches the Ascend operator library and upper-layer application ecosystem.

## Performance Benchmarking
### Performance Charts of Key Operators
The key operators FA, MM, and Softmax that have been optimized are selected as examples. The following charts show the performance differences between Triton operators and AscendC operators. The metric is the speedup ratio (`Speedup = AscendC_Duration_Time/Triton_Duration_Time`). For details, see the [Optimization Guide](./docs/en/debug_guide/profiling.md).
