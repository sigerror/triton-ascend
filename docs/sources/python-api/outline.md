## 约束说明

- dot: 两个输入A[batch(optional), M, K], B[batch(optional), K, N]。

- gather: triton.gather(x, index, axis)，假设x的shape为n维度，目前只支持axis=n-1。

- permute: triton.permute(x, dims)，不支持dims=[2, 1, 0]。

- trans: triton.trans(x, dims)，不支持dims=[2, 1 , 0]。

- device_print: 需要增加1个环境变量，TRITON_DEVICE_PRINT=1。

- device_assert: 生效需要设置两个环境变量，TRITON_DEBUG=1，TRITON_DEVICE_PRINT=1。

- atomic_add: 昇腾不支持atomic_add实现多核add+保存中间结果，需要修改成普通add来保存中间结果

- atomic类op: 对于昇腾后端，sem只支持默认值"acq_rel"模式，其他值均按默认值处理；scope只支持默认值"gpu"，其他值均按默认值处理

- atomic_or/atomic_xor/atomic_and/atomic_xchg/atomic_cas: 昇腾暂不支持在loop中使用

- permute: 不支持不相邻轴转置，如`(0, 1, 2) -> (2, 1, 0)`

- trans: 不支持不相邻轴转置，如`(0, 1, 2) -> (2, 1, 0)`

- umulhi: 不支持负数输入

- mod: int64仅支持处理 -2^24 ~ 2^24 范围内的数值

- rand类op: 所支持的数据类型仅针对算子的输出。

- ALL: int8类型由于特殊处理，会占用更大的片上空间，编译时容易造成ub overflow报错，通常调整tilling即可解决
- ALL: triton kernel中同时存在所有tensor总和不能超过96KB，若关闭double buffer，则不能超过192KB
- ALL: 所有tensor不允许某个shape的size小于1
- ALL: ✓*表示triton内部将bool类型转为int8类型进行运算，并能够执行得到结果的OP
- ALL: 不支持使用shape为"[[]]"的标量tensor进行计算
